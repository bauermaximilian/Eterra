# Eterra Platforms

Eterra platform providers for various operating systems and devices.

## About

This project solution contains the currently supported platforms for the _Eterra Framework_ project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/bauermaximilian/Eterra). There you'll also find the description of what the _Eterra Framework_ actually is and how to use it and the most recent information about the current project state and the development roadmap.

## Build instructions

This project uses the _Eterra Framework_ - that solution needs to be cloned/copied into the same root directory like this _Eterra Platforms_ project solution for the build to be successful. Before the first build, restoring the used NuGet packages is required - this can also solve issues especially when using projects from this solution in other applications (e.g. the _Eterra Demos_).

## Special thanks to

The various resources for learning modern OpenGL from ground up, especially [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) by [Joey de Vries](https://twitter.com/JoeyDeVriez) and  [tomdalling.com](https://www.tomdalling.com) by... well, [Tom Dalling](https://twitter.com/tom_dalling) - if you want to understand the fundamentals of graphic programming, I highly recommend these resources, even if you don't know anything about C++ or maths (neither did I).
